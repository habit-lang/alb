-- A restricted clause is the result of comparing a goal predicate with an axiom conclusion under a
-- functional dependency, which occurs in both improvementFromAxioms and applyAxiom. This can be
-- either:
--
-- * Irrelevant, if the goal and conclusion do not match on the determining parameters;
-- * Confirming, if the goal matches the conclusion on the determining parameters and the conclusion
--   matches the goal on the the determined parameters; or,
-- * Contradicting, if the goal matches the conclusion on the determining parameters, but the
--   conclusion does not match the goal on the determined parameters, or the flags of the goal and
--   conclusion do not agree.
-- * Intersecting, if the goal and conclusion unify, but do not match, on the determining parameters.
--
-- The payloads and uses of the various states differ between the two uses of the type.

-- NOTES: restrict is used both in applyAxiom and in improvementFromAxioms/necessaryFromAssumptions.
-- These usages differ in their treatment of the positions outside the functional dependency.  In
-- the former case, if the goal differs from the conclusion at one of these positions, the
-- conclusions is irrelevant, whereas in the latter case they play no role at all.
--
--   The treatment of Contradicting is currently broken.  Suppose that we have
--
--    C a b c | a ~> b
--    C Int Float Bool.
--
-- And then we provide the query C Int Bool t.  The instance above is being treated as Intersecting,
-- depending on the additional condition [t :-> Bool].  But this is not the case: contradiction can
-- be established on the basis of the functional dependency alone.

-- improvementFromAxioms axioms fds goal computes an improvement to the variables in goal, without
-- assuming which, if any, axiom may solve goal.  This is useful both for computing improvements
-- from assumptions and for finding improvements from predicates that cannot yet be solved.  An
-- example of the latter, from tests/solver/tests/impr1:
--
-- > C t u v | t ~> u.
-- > D u v | u ~> v.
-- >
-- > C Int Float Bool.
-- > C Int Float Char.
-- > D Float Bool.
-- >
-- > C Int u v, D u v?
--
-- The solver does not have enough information to discharge the predicate 'C Int u v': parameter 'v'
-- is not determined.  However, the solver does have enough information to improve variable 'u';
-- this, in turn, allows the predicate 'D u v' to be discharged, improving variable 'v' and allowing
-- predicate 'C Int u v' to be discharged.  In this case, the solution is that the predicates hold
-- under the improvement [Float/u, Bool/v].

-- applyAxiom attempts to apply the available axioms to the current goal.  Should we find a matching
-- axiom, we assume that axioms applies, and introduce corresponding functional dependency
-- assumptions.  This may be a stronger set of assumptions than can arise from simply assuming the
-- goal holds; for example, given the program:
-- > F t u | t ~> u.
-- > F t True if C t; F t False.
-- and the goal
-- > F Int t?
-- simply assuming the goal holds gives no improvement for 't' (as it could be either True or
-- False).  However, assuming that the first clause of the axiom applies gives the improvement
-- [True/t]
